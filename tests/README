To run the unit tests, use the following:

    phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml

You can also run tests for just the controllers:

    phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml --group Controllers

or just the models:

    phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml --group Models

By default, coverage reports and TestDox are generated in the logs/ 
subdirectory.

If you are using OS X with Mac Ports, you might have more luck running the tests with this command:

    phpunit --verbose --configuration phpunit.xml --include-path=".:/opt/local/www/ZendFramework/library:/opt/local/www/ZendFramework/extra/library"
